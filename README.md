GLOBAL Grade of the project: 15 (??????)


**SUMMARY:**

We've implemented a compiler of Java-- language to Java bytecodes. This compiler includes syntactic and semantic analysis, and Jasmin code generation too.


**SEMANTIC ANALYSIS:**


**CODE GENERATION:**



**PROS:**



**CONS:**

Time was too short for the size of the project, plus we had to deal with half the team giving up.
So until they said they quit, we had to work for 4, which delayed everything.
